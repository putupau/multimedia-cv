## Project Analysis: Who's the final user?
The portfolio is addressed to a mix of both formal and informal audiences. The portfolio design is focused on **providing an adaptable experience, both approachable and professional**. For users who need a comprehensive, more detailed or formal CV, the site provides an option to download a classic CV in PDF format. This format allows hiring managers and other formal users to quickly access a version that may be preferred for official purposes.

## Project Analysis: Information Architecture
The website is divided into three sections: **About, Resume, and Contact**. I've preferred each section to have its own HTML & CSS. This helps with webpage maintenance, since it allows me to modify each section individually without having to risk the rest of the structure in case anything fails, which offers clarity and security of the project.

- **About Section**: This section provides a brief introduction, where users can learn about my background and motivation to become a computer engineer.
  
- **Resume Section**: Here, the user can check out my resume in a web format, which offers an **easy-to-read version** for casual browsing. However, if the user prefers a formal approach, they can download the classic PDF CV format directly, offering both informal and formal approaches.

- **Contact Section**: Last but not least, users can access my contact information, such as my email and LinkedIn profile offering an easy and professional communication with the click-to-email feature and click-to-social, redirecting to my LinkedIn profile.

## Project Analysis: Visual Design
The visual design is intentionally minimal and straightforward. I focused on avoiding unnecessary complexity to keep usersâ€™ attention on the content. The color palette is neutral, professional, and unobtrusive, which enhances readability and ensures that no single element overwhelms the page. Small color accents are used on buttons and headings to subtly guide attention without overpowering the design.

I wanted an easy and direct design, as minimalistic as possible. Focused on avoiding distracting features so that I can keep user attention on the content. The color palette s neutral and professional, which makes it easy to look at.

For typography, I've chosen the popular **Poppins** font, a free, Google-provided font by the Indian Type Foundry and Jonny Pinhorn. It makes it easy to read and provides a friendly and professional appearance. This choice aligns with my goal of a balanced design, for both formal and informal users.

## Project Inspiration
I opted for this straightforward structure, inspired by a mix of a YouTube portfolio tutorial and a business template on Wix. This, again, ensures that the site is accessible for both formal and informal users.
